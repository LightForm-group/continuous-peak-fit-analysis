Example Data
-----------

Example data files can be downloaded from Zenodo. Please download these data files and unzip them into this folder, retaining the folder structure, to run an example analysis with Continuous-Peak-Fit.

To run the Continuous-Peak-Fit analysis you will first need to create .poni and .mask calibration files from a calibration standard diffraction pattern image, such as CeO2 or LaB6, using the software [Dioptas](http://www.clemensprescher.com/programs/dioptas). Instructions on using Dioptas to create calibration files from calibrant diffraction pattern images can be found [here](https://lightform-group.github.io/wiki/tutorials/sxrd-caking-dioptas).

An example CeO2 calibration file can be downloaded from 103852-calibration.zip in [Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction Analysis - Measuring Bulk Crystallographic Texture from Differently-Orientated Ti-6Al-4V Samples](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7311323). This contains both the .poni and .mask files needed for calibration.

To test the fitting of a series of diffraction pattern images, which were recorded in an X-Y stage-scan of a Ti-6Al-4V specimen, download rawdata_6.zip from [Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction Dataset - Measuring Bulk Crystallographic Texture from Differently-Orientated Ti-6Al-4V Samples](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7311306). This contains a series of raw .cbf diffraction pattern images.
