    "The intensity data calculated from the Continuous-Peak-Fit must be associated with the correct spherical polar coordinates, so that it can be easily loaded and analysed in [MTEX](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io) - a toolbox for analysing and plotting texture in MATLAB.\n",

    "**Diffraction pattern rings**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each diffraction pattern ring is a 2D circle of intensity points collected on a detector, with the spots around the ring directly related to the orientation of a grain's lattice plane within the sample *i.e. diffraction spots at the top or bottom of the ring correspond to grains with their the lattice plane aligned parrallel with the top or bottom surface of the sample, or the lattice plane pole aligned parrallel with normal to the top or bottom of the sample.* Therefore, this diffraction pattern ring can be thought of as the edge of a pole figure. In actual fact there is a slight offset, due to the Bragg scattering angle (2${\\theta}), but for small angles we can usually ignore this. In a synchrotron experiment we typically only measure a small subset of sample orientations, but to plot this data correctly we need to represent our 2D plane of intenstity measurements in 3D, to calculate the crystal structure with respect to the sample directions e.g. as an ODF or pole figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spherical polar coordinates**\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle 3D intensity data for different lattice planes, MTEX uses spherical polar coordinates. The polar coordinates are defined by a polar angle, ${\\theta}$, from ${0^\\circ}$ (North) to ${180^\\circ}$ (South), and an azimuthal angle, ${\\phi}$, from ${0^\\circ}$ to ${360^\\circ}$. The X-axis is aligned along ${\\phi = 0^\\circ}$, the Y-axis is along ${\\phi = 90^\\circ}$ and the Z-axis is along ${\\theta = 0^\\circ}$. Note, this is using the *physics* convention of polar coordinates, rather than the *maths* convention, and there are no negative values in this definition. \n",

    "**Sample orientaion**\n",
    "\n",
    "For our experiment there were six different rolled sample orientations. The typical convention is that ${X = RD}$, ${Y = TD}$ and ${Z = ND}$. For this demonstration and to avoid confusion we will use the alignments with respect to X, Y and Z. So, there are six possible planes our circle (of intensity points) could lie along in 3D;\n",

    "\n",
    "To plot the path of a circle in 3D, we need to parameterise the solution. The parameteric solution for a circle lying in the X-Y plane, with a radius, R, and centred at (0,0) is ${X^2 + Y^2 = R^2}$, where ${X = R \\cos(\\alpha)}$ and ${Y = R \\sin(\\alpha)}$ and the rotation angle ${\\alpha \\in [0, 2 \\pi]}$. If the circle lies on a different plane then we assign the corresponding X (horizonatal) and Y (vertical) axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, if our circle is tilted, we need to describe the tilt, as is shown [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/215880/equation-for-making-a-circle-in-3d-space). Let's take the circle tilted between X-Y and X-Z as an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we parameterise the expression for the circle on each plane, which gives us the solution ${X = R \\cos(\\alpha)}$, ${Y = R \\sin(\\alpha)}$ and ${Z = R \\sin(\\alpha)}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The plane of the circle can lie at an angle ${\\beta \\in [0, \\pi / 2]}$ from the horizontal, between the Y and Z axis. This defines a right-angled triangle which we can solve using trigonometry. So, the adjacent side is ${Y = \\cos(\\beta)}$ and the opposite side is ${Z = \\sin(\\beta)}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Putting this together, then gives us our parameteric solution to draw a circle of points that is centred at (0,0), with ${\\alpha \\in [0, 2 \\pi]}$, and titled between X-Y and X-Z by an angle ${\\beta \\in [0, \\pi / 2]}$. In our case, ${\\beta = \\pi / 4 = 45 ^\\circ}$, and ${R = 1}$;\n",

    "\n",
    "This plots the path of our circle in *cartesian coordinates*. However, we then need to convert this to *spherical polar coordinates* to match with our intensity data and to feed into MTEX.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert to polar coordinates we use the standard formula with the *physics* convention described [here]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system);\n",

    "However, we need to use the 2-argument arctangent ([atan2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2)) expression to handle negative X and Y values. And, the above expression will return azimuthal angles within the range from -180 to 180, which will need to be converted to a range from 0 to 360 (which is the convention in MTEX)."
