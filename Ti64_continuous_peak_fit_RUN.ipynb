It then fits the results of the peak position, height, width, etc. with a Fourier expansion (defined by the number of terms specified in the input file). Then, it fits the entire peak with separate Fourier expansions for the position, height, width, etc. And finally, a combined Fourier expansion is fitted to the entire data. This Fourier description is then matched to any subsequent diffraction pattern images.\n",
