Example Analysis
-----------

Example analysis files can be downloaded from Zenodo. Please download these analysis files and unzip them into this folder, retaining the folder structure, to run an example analysis with Continuous-Peak-Fit and to run an example analysis with MTEX to plot crystallographic texture.

To fit a single diffraction pattern image, which has been created to provide a bulk crystallographic texture measurement of a single Ti-6Al-4V specimen orientation, download 103840.zip from [Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction Analysis - Measuring Bulk Crystallographic Texture from Differently-Orientated Ti-6Al-4V Samples](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7311323). This contains a single .tiff diffraction pattern image.

To calculate crystallographic texture from a set of 6 different sample orientations, download all of the .zip files from [Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction Analysis - Measuring Bulk Crystallographic Texture from Differently-Orientated Ti-6Al-4V Samples](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7311323). You can try to recalulcate the fits to the lattice plane intensities using Continuous-Peak-Fit, or you can use the already calculated fit files with the notebooks and MTEX.
