JSON Files
-----------

This folder of .json configuration files contains input parameters for running alpha and beta phase crystallographic texture analyses using MTEX. 

The configuration files do not contain file paths, because the user can click to navigate to the analysis and results folders using a GUI generated from the MTEX script, in the MATLAB console.
